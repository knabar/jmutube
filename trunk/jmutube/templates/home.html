<h3>Tagging, Impersonation, and Org Accounts. Oh My! &bull; <span>April 21st, 2009</span></h3>
<br>
<p>Okay, that title is a stretch, but we have indeed added three big new features to JMUTube this week.</p>
<ul>
	<li><h4>Tagging</h4><p>You can now add tags to both videos and presentations. You'll notice a new tagging bar at the top of your files list and checkboxes next to each title. Choosing a tag (or new tag) from the drop-down menu will add that tag to any files with a check next to it. You can then use these tags to filter your view, as each tag appears in the "Show Only" list. Clicking on the green underlined SMAD202 in the image below for example would show only titles with the SMAD202 tag.</p><p align="center"><img src="/static/images/screenshots/jmutube_tagging.jpg" style="border:solid thin black;" width="464" height="232"/></p></li>
	
	<li><h4>Impersonation</h4><p>It's common for instructors to have GAs do some of the work within JMUtube, but until now the only way to handle this was to give the GA your e-ID, which you really shouldn't do. So we've added a feature that allows a user to pretend to be you within JMUtube (with your permission of course). You'll need to contact Grover Saunders at <a href="mailto:saundebn@jmu.edu">saundebn@jmu.edu</a> to connect the two accounts, but once your accounts have been configured, the other user can log into JMUtube using their account, click the new Options menu, pick your name out of the list, and start uploading and deploying content from your account.</p><p>It's worth noting that the Options page will appear blank unless impersonation has been set up for your account.</p></li>

	<li><h4>Organizational Accounts</h4><p>If you're using JMUtube on behalf of your department, you may be in a situation where you're putting departmental content into a personal account. This could create problems if that responsibility moves to someone else, you move on to another position. Along with the impersonation feature comes the ability to create accounts for departments and organizations. Then, you can simply impersonate that departmental account just as you would any other user.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>We hope you find these new features useful. Please let us know if you have any trouble with them, and if there are other features you'd like to see in the future.</p>


<h3>Features Updated, Look Still Being Tweaked &bull; <span>April 20th, 2009</span></h3>
<p>The upgrade over the weekend was a success. A few visual issues with the interface remain, but new features are available. The features will get their own post later today.</p>
